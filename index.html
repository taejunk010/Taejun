        I am a 2nd year student attending UC Riverside. I am going to graduate in 2022. Currently, I have been working towards a Political Science degree. Throughout these two years, I had the chance to work in many different fields. Some fields include: customer service, and tutoring. I have worked at a dessert shop during my senior year of high school from the months of January to June. I had to quit due to me wanting to travel during the summer before I started college. In the dessert store, I was the cashier and a barista. In this workplace, I made various types of drinks, sold desserts, cleaned the location, packaged the desserts, and washed the dishes. Another place I worked at was at a cold noodle store. I was working until the COVID-19 struck and was fired due to this. In this work, I cleaned, took orders, and made cold noodles as well. I also helped make the various banchan that were included in our meals. As well as making the food, I helped the employers come up with new menu items and try the food and tell them my opinion about the food. Lastly, I worked as a tutor in an academy. I tutored Junior High students helping them with various subjects. I learned how to be patient, listen, and understand a clientâ€™s mind through all these job experiences. Also, through these various jobs, I learned the importance of needing to do the very best you can because that is the most important thing you can do as an employee. From these various jobs, I hope I can help out the business in any way shape or form. I can speak two languages: Korean and English and  am loved by the customers as well as the employer. I am very respectful, courteous, hardworking, and always on time. I believe that my best trait is the ability to be always on time. Ever since I was young, my parents drilled the value into me of always being on time or earlier. Due to my parentsâ€™ drilling this into my everyday life, I hope to be the best example of an employee that others can follow and trust. Through this job opportunity, I hope to get experiences that I can later use in my career that will center around customer service and helping out people in need. My educational career includes: currently working on a BA for Political Science at UC Riverside, graduated Sunny Hills High School, and am currently studying for LSAT to hopefully get into UCLA Law School.
